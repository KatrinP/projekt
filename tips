### Git ###
To list untracked files try:
  git ls-files --others --exclude-standard
Nice alias for adding untracked files:
  au = !git add $(git ls-files -o --exclude-standard)

You can unstage files from the index using
  git reset HEAD -- path/to/file


I did little research and it seems that the best option to exclude only files inside "sim_case" folder is to use:

    **/sim_case/*
    !**/sim_case/include

That allows to have more complex file structure

    test/sim_case/include
    test1/sim_case/include
    etc.

The result from "git status" is:

    On branch master

    Initial commit

    Changes to be committed:
      (use "git rm --cached <file>..." to unstage)

        new file:   .gitignore
        new file:   test/file1
        new file:   test/file2
        new file:   test/sim_case/include/file1
        new file:   test/sim_case/include/file2
        new file:   test1/file1
        new file:   test1/file2
        new file:   test1/sim_case/include/file1
        new file:   test1/sim_case/include/file2
